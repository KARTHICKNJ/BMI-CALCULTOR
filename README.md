# BMI-CALCULTOR
A BMI Calculator on GitHub is a project that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height. It usually includes input fields for height and weight, a function to compute BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height), and a result display indicating BMI and health category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight).
